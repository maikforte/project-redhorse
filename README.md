### What the hell?
Okay, I'm tired of re-creating new Flask back-end over and over again when working on a project.

It's called RedHorse because the project is Flask... He he he.

### Testing
Unit testing is very very simple. The project uses [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) - a framework that makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries (Lul copy pasta!)

To run the test, simply navigate to the project folder and run `pytest`

### Linting
Lint configuration is based-off of [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)

Q: Can't see the Flake8 config?

A: Ha! This is a TODO section. Sorry ma-boi

To run the lint, navigate to the project folder and run `flake8 <regex>`

### Quickstart
1. Fork the repo
1. Navigate to the project folder
1. Run `flask run`
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000/apidocs`
